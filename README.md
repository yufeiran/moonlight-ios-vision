# Moonlight XrOS

[Moonlight for VisionOs/iOS/tvOS](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source client for [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) and NVIDIA GameStream. Moonlight for iOS/tvOS allows you to stream your full collection of games and apps from your powerful desktop computer to your iOS device or Apple TV.

It also supports a Sunshine fork called [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo) which on Windows supports a Built-in Virtual Display with HDR support that matches the resolution/framerate config of your client automatically.

Moonlight also has a [PC client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) and [Android client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android).

### Yu Moonlight build 26

Backports the common library's [speculative RFI fix](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c/commit/62e066388f1a1b133e0bee947b9a374311a3354b). When reference-frame invalidation (RFI) is unavailable, a reordered packet could previously trigger an IDR wait without requesting a keyframe, dropping up to 120 consecutive frames. The fix only enables speculative loss reporting when RFI is negotiated; normal FEC, actual-loss recovery, and enabled RFI behavior remain intact.

The common submodule points to a minimal backport in `yufeiran/moonlight-common-c`, based on the existing `a517f7c` revision. Clone recursively so the fix is included. To run the native macOS regression harness with address/undefined-behavior sanitizers:

```sh
sh Tests/run-video-reorder-regression.sh
```

The harness sends synthetic RTP packets through the real FEC queue and depacketizer, covering host/decoder RFI availability, reordered complete frames, sequence wraparound, actual packet loss, and RFI recovery.

## ChangeLog (Latest: v11.0.22 - April 26, 2026)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE:**
> If you are coming from an older version (pre-11.0.15), please **Uninstall and Reinstall** the app via TestFlight. There are significant code changes regarding settings and localization that may cause crashes if you simply update over the old version.

> *** I RECOMEND USING APOLLO OVER SUNSHINE**
> [RikuKunMS2/Lumanaire](https://ko-fi.com/lumanaire) tests all builds using Apollo. Apollo is a Sunshine fork called [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo) which on Windows supports a Built-in Virtual Display with HDR support that matches the resolution/framerate config of your client automatically. 
>* **Apollo Permissions:** *Critical Note* — If using Apollo, you **must** ensure all permissions are enabled after pairing (Click the "Edit" button in Apollo). The developer primarily tests on Apollo.


### v11.0.22 (April 26, 2026)
* **Navigation Stability:** Fixed a bug causing the app to freeze when clicking 'Return to Home' while a second paired computer is offline by prioritizing the actively streaming host.
* **UIKit Stream Recovery:** Resolved an issue in UIKit mode where the 'Return to Home' button would occasionally fail to navigate or cause the application to crash.
* **Control Panel UI:** Realigned the UIKit mode control panel ornament to reliably anchor to the top edge of the window, ensuring visual consistency with RealityKit mode.
* **Home Screen Panel UI:** Set static position of the home screen menu so that it appears in front of the user in a static area (utility panel area) ensuring visual consistency when opening the home screen panel.
* **Virtual Keyboard UI:** Fixed an interaction regression in RealityKit mode where the supplementary PC-modifier toolbar (Windows/Esc keys) failed to trigger alongside the virtual keyboard.
* **AppIntent Shortcuts:** Fixed the ability to launch directly into a host via the Shortcuts app (AppIntent).

### v11.0.21 (April 25, 2026)
* **Audio Pipeline Refactor:** Complete migration of the spatial audio pipeline (`OutputAU`) to pure Objective-C.
* **Vision Pro Spatial Audio:** Restored functional audio streaming by properly activating `AVAudioSession` and integrating native `SpatialAudioComponent` for RealityKit. Fixed Opus decoding integration and eliminated "Session lookup failed" crashes.
* **SharePlay & Spatial Personas:** Integrated SharePlay-based co-watching using Spatial Personas for shared immersive viewing experiences.
* **Reactive Lighting (Ambilight):** Added a user-configurable Reactive Lighting toggle within the immersive control panel.
* **HDR Consistency & Calibration:** Re-enabled 1:1 HDR EDR mapping for perfect RealityKit HDR and introduced a Calibration Mode toggle in the immersive control panel.
* **UIKit Stream Recovery:** Added an "Open Main Menu" recovery button to the error overlay in UIKitStreamView to escape stuck window states on failed stream resumptions.

### v11.0.17 (Expected Release: Nov 25, 2025)
* **AV1 & HDR Confirmation:** Confirmed that AV1 and AV1 HDR are working correctly on M5 devices. Special thanks to **u/webheadVR** for testing.
* **Localization:** Fixed various localization strings (Thanks **linggan-ua**).
* **Shimmering:** Fixed the shimmering issue in Reality Kit.
* **Apollo Permissions:** *Critical Note* — If using Apollo, you **must** ensure all permissions are enabled after pairing (Click the "Edit" button in Apollo). The developer primarily tests on Apollo.

    * Fixed curved screen distortion math.
    * Fixed settings saving and updated defaults.
    * Fixed volume object clipping (position is now clamped).
    * Improved Home/Resume button reliability.

## Noted Bugs & Known Issues

* **MVD Audio Stutter:** If you run Mac Virtual Display alongside Moonlight in Reality Kit, audio may stutter. This does not happen if you are connected via a Developer Strap.
* **UI/UX:** The interface is currently "Function over Form." We are working on a better UI, but for now, we are prioritizing features and stability.
* **Controller Issues:**
    * PS4 Touchpad does not work (SDL3 issue).
    * PS5 Controllers may have general issues.
    * Controller vibration is currently not working.
* **Touchscreen Mode** Moonlight XrOS does not send touch events like it does on the iOS / iPadOS version to windows.
* **General Jank:** Eye position mouse moving is an OS-level behavior; cursor pointer snapping when lifting fingers off the trackpad cannot currently be fixed.
* **Tap to Click in Reality Kit** Moonlight XrOS does not allow for tap to click and tap to drag in realitykit mode
* **The virtual keyboard button is not working in reality kit** We are looking into fixing this.
* **Dimming Button in UIKit** The dimming button does not function in UIKit mode, we are looking into this



## FAQ
* **I'm using Apollo and it won't connect/launch?**
    * **CRITICAL:** After pairing, click the **EDIT** button in Apollo and make sure **ALL PERMISSIONS** are turned ON.
* **How do I fix the audio or mouse stutter?**
    * If you are multitasking with Mac Virtual Display, this is a known issue. Connecting via a Developer Strap seems to resolve the interference.
* **How do I move the Immersive Screen?**
    * Click the **Lock** button to "Unlock" the position. You can then move/recenter the screen. Click Lock again to set it.
* **Why does the UI look basic?**
    * We are a volunteer team prioritizing functionality (AV1, HDR, 120fps) over visual polish right now. A UI overhaul is planned for the future.
* **How do I fix HDR color?**
    * We recomend looking at a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXb3EKWsInQ) or [image](https://depositphotos.com/vector/printer-marks-printing-cutting-and-calibration-109759386.html) to calibrate against to calibrate 
* **UIKit vs Reality Kit?**
    * Use **UIKit** if you need 100% reliable Mouse + Keyboard support (though Reality Kit support is now available and improved).
    * Use **Reality Kit** for Curved Screens, 3D SBS, and AR features.
* **How do I use Ultrawide Mode?**
    * In settings set the resolution to 5120x1440, then set up [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo) or a virtual display driver on Windows.
* **Why is my connection choppy?**
    * While the app has entitlements to suppress AWDL, using features like AirDrop or Handoff in the background may cause interference. Use 5GHz Ch 149 (US) / Ch 44 (EU) / Ch 6 (2.4GHz) for best results.
* **Recommended Settings:**
    * **Resolution:** 4K
    * **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
    * **Framerate:** 60fps (120fps is tested)
    * **Bitrate:** 50mbps (Higher is supported but requires M2/M5 and strong network)
    * **Renderer:** Reality Kit

* **How do I configure 5.1 or 7.1 Surround Sound?**
    * Moonlight Vision natively requests 7.1 surround sound. For this to work, your host PC must output 5.1 or 7.1 audio so that Sunshine/Apollo can capture the discrete channels.
    * 1. On your Windows Host, open the Sound Control Panel (Press `Win+R`, type `mmsys.cpl`).
    * 2. Select your default playback device (or virtual audio cable) and click **Configure**.
    * 3. Choose **7.1 Surround** or **5.1 Surround** and complete the wizard. *(If your physical audio device doesn't support 7.1, you can install a Virtual Audio Cable like VB-Cable, set it to 7.1, and make it the default device).*
    * 4. Open the **Sunshine / Apollo Web UI** and navigate to the **Audio** tab.
    * 5. Set the **Channels** configuration to `7.1` or `5.1` (or `Stereo` if you want to bypass surround entirely).
    * 6. Restart Sunshine/Apollo.
    * 7. In Moonlight Vision, cycle the audio button to **7.1 Surround** to enable native spatial processing.

## Feature Requests / Planned Features:
* Microphone Support.
* Updates to SDL3 (to fix PS4 touchpad issues).
* Unpin immersive settings (to allow reset if window becomes too far/small).
